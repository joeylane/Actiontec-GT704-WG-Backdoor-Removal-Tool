Actiontec-GT704-WG-Backdoor-Removal-Tool
========================================
This is a simple Python 3 script I wrote that removes the ISP backdoor web interface (port 4567) on the Actiontec GT704-WG DSL modem/router. It also erases and deactivates the router activity log which cannot normally be disabled in this router. I have not tested this on any other brand/model of router. Using this script on another model will almost certainly break something. Use it only on the GT704-WG. Requires Python 3 to be installed on the computer running the script.
